# STARFACE — Concept Reveal Landing (Static)

Minimal, KAWS-inspired teaser page to build early interest and collect emails (placeholder alert for now).

## Files
- `index.html` — single-page site using Tailwind CDN (no build step needed)

## How to Deploy on Vercel
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., `starface-website`).
2. Upload `index.html` to the repo.
3. In Vercel, click **Add New → Project → Import from GitHub** and pick the repo.
4. Build settings: **Framework Preset: Other** (no build command needed).
5. Click **Deploy**. Your site will be live in ~30 seconds.
6. Connect your Namecheap domain in **Vercel → Settings → Domains** and follow the DNS instructions.

## Customizing
- Replace the hero image URL in `index.html` with your blurred/silhouette image.
- When ready, wire the form to a provider (Mailchimp/Brevo) by replacing the JavaScript submit handler.
